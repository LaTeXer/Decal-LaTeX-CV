\ressubheading{\hypertarget{Mosquitogrant}Multisensory Integration in Mosquitos}{Seatle, WA}{Fairhall Lab, University of Washington}{Oct. 2014 $\rightarrow$ Now}
I create agent-based dynamical models of mosquito flight behavior and benchmark the models against wind-tunnel behavioral data.\\ % These models will be further validated using electrophysiological \& tethered flight data to test theories about multi-modal decision making.\\
    
 \ressubheading{\hypertarget{whalevolunteering}Humpback Whale Census}{James Price Point, Australia}{Kimberley Community Whale Research Project}{Aug. 2012 $\rightarrow$ Oct. 2012}
    A community-initiated peer-review at the proposed site of the world's second-largest liquefied gas processing port. This peer-review's estimates of humpback migration and breeding activity near James Price Point revealed gross discrepancies in the original oil conglomerate's survey.  \\ %old link\href{http://tinyurl.com/JPP-humpback-whale-survey-2013}{peer-review}'s

    \ressubheading{Honors Baccalaureate Thesis}{Sarasota, FL}{Walstrom Lab, New College of Florida}{Aug. 2010 $\rightarrow$ May 2011}
   My capstone \hyperlink{thesispub}{thesis project} proposes a model for RNA Helicase A function in endogenous \emph{C. elegans} RNAi pathways.\\ % My baccalaureate exam was administered by a committee of faculty and consisted of a thesis defense followed by a comprehensive oral exam covering all courses I took at New College.\\

    \ressubheading{Tutorials}{Sarasota, FL}{New College of Florida}{Aug. 2007 $\rightarrow$ May 2011}
    I created classes using New College's tutorial system, in which students are able to design courses in collaboration with faculty.

    I helped establish a method to grow, stain, and image primary dopaminergic neural culture from \textit{Drosophila} embryos in order to test whether Parkin and PINK1, proteins involved in Parkinson's disease, are recruited to depolarized mitochondria in dopaminergic neurons. This research was \hyperlink{neuronpub}{published} in \textit{PNAS}.\\

%    \ressubheading{Lab Technician}{Sarasota, FL}{New College of Florida Dept. of Natural Sciences}{Feb. 2010 $\rightarrow$ Sep. 2010}
%    Routine duties for the department, including autoclaving and disposing lab waste, preparing and sterilized solutions and agar plates, and preparing lab courses as needed. \\

    \ressubheading{Organic Lab Research Tutorial}{Sarasota, FL}{Scudder Lab, New College of Florida}{Sep. 2008 $\rightarrow$ Nov. 2009}
    I partially synthesized precursors to a novel high-valent iron-stabilizing macrocycle based on the active site of cytochrome P450.\\ % My work was summarized in a paper entitled, ``Towards Synthesis of a Cytochrome P450 Mimic".\\ % A continuation of New College graduate Dan Kaplan's thesis research.

    \ressubheading{Summer Undergraduate Research Program (NSF-REU)}{Pittsburgh, PA}{McCartney Lab, Carnegie Mellon University}{May 2009 $\rightarrow$ Aug. 2009}
    I determined that APC2, a protein with probable roles in colon cancer tumorogenesis, did not interact with $\beta$-catenin of the Wnt pathway's destruction complex. I determined that APC2's conserved N-terminal domain was not essential for its proper localization. This research was \hyperlink{carnegiepub}{published} in \textit{Genetics}.\\
    
%    \ressubheading{Independent Study Project}{Sarasota, FL}{New College of Florida}{Jan. 2009}
%    A 4-week project conducted under the direction of Dr.\ Necmettin Yildirim. Using MATLAB, we modelled biological and chemical systems, particularly oscillating kinetic systems such as the Brusselator.\\ % I presented my work in a seminar entitled, ``Modelling the Dynamics of Life".\\

    \ressubheading{Independent Study Project}{Sarasota, FL}{McCord Lab, New College of Florida}{Jan. 2008}
    I studied chromatographic theory and operated gas and high-pressure liquid chromatographs.\\ % I researched and isolated triclosan, a ubiquitous bactericide and suspect carcinogen.\\
